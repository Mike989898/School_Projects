### TESTING

# Compilation

To compile `fuzzquery` run the command in the `query` directory `make fuzzquery`.

Making the `querier.c` can be done with just `make` in the toplevel file or in `querier/`

# Testing


## Manual Testing
While building we tested on a small index we had crawled from depth 2 starting at `old-www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~kotz` and ran several simple queries to make sure the results seemed right, checking the index manually to confirm. 

Finally we ran fuzzquery on Kotz's given index at `~cs50/crawler/nytimes-depth2/index` for 100 queries. 

`fuzzquery ~cs50/crawler/nytimes-depth2/index 100 97 > example.txt`

Then we ran these queries (using valgrind) on the querier. Like:

`valgrind querier ~cs50/crawler/nytimes-depth2/data ~cs50/crawler/nytimes-depth2/index < example.txt`

After checking there were no memory leaks we went into the index and checked the last 5 queries to make sure the results seem reasonable (that is, we manually did the last 5 queries ourselves by searching through the index and making sure the top results had the correct numbers).

We also ran valgrind with 10000 queries generated by fuzzquery, to check for memory leaks and found none. We did not manually check any of these results.


## Automated Testing

We didn't have any automated testing.
