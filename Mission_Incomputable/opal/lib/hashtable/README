Compilation:
	The program can either be compiled using the make file or using the following testing command:
            gcc -Wall -pedantic -std=c11 -ggdb hashtable.c hashtabletest.c -o hashtabletest

Execution:
	For testing:
	The program can be run like this: ./hashtabletest
	Usage: ./hashtabletest

Assumptions:
	I assumed that the user mgiht pass NULL as the object, and as a result in every function I exit the function, doing my best to alert the user that I failed. I also assumed the user would choose a slot number that was apropriate for the number of items they want to insert.
