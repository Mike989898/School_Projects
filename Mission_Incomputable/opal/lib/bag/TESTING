When testing this module I created a short program to add a static set of things into the bag, and extract them. The output of this is:

     Successfully created a new bag
     -----Inserting-----
     After inserting
     {
     And CS50 is one of those things
     Aren't what they seem
     Lots of things
     }
     ----Extracting-----
     Extracted And CS50 is one of those things
     Extracted Aren't what they seem
     Extracted Lots of things
     Bag is empty

In doing this I test that I can create a bag, add anything I want to into it, and extract them one by one in some order until the bag is empty.

I also created a feature that would allow the user to type in things to add to the bag, and it would add them and promptly extract them to show order
