Compilation:
	The program can either be compiled using the make file or using the following testing command:
	    gcc -Wall -pedantic -std=c11 -ggdb list.c listtest.c -o listtest

Execution:
	For testing:
	The testing program can be run like this: ./listtest
	Usage: ./listtest
	
Assumptions:
	When I created the module, I assumed that the user might pass me a NULL list, or even a NULL key, and I deal with it by not executing the program they are trying to use. As well, I allow the user to put any data they want into the list.
