# Hello, and Welcome to my repository for the school projects I've completed!

## Contents

In this repository, you will find four different projects: A digital radio project, an Android Application that teachs people how to dance (DanceMaster), a tiny search engine (TSE), and a software project to simmulate a spy mission (Mission incomputable). This is just a sampling of software projects I've completed as an undergraduate. Each project has a README file that you can take a look at for more information about the project. I hope you enjoy looking around and getting a flavor for my software design experience :smile: :thumbsup:!
